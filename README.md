# talkie
26-04-2021
Talkie is meant to be a daily companion. An app on your phone that talks to you, advices you randomly and somehow be some sort of virtual, non-intrusive, there when you need it friend.

At least that was the goal when started it. I hope it does all that and more eventually.

Right now, all it does is to randomly dispense advice as long as you keep clicking Next.
(Thanks to  'https://api.adviceslip.com/advice').

It is written (and shall continue to be written) in flutter.
Y'all are welcome to contribute.
